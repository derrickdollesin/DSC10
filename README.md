# DSC10
 Assignments from DSC10 at UCSD

This first course in data science introduces students to data exploration, statistical inference, and prediction. It introduces the Python programming language as a tool for tabular data manipulation, visualization, and simulation. Through homework assignments and projects, students are given an opportunity to develop their analytical skills while working with real-world datasets from a variety of domains.

 Midterm Project:
 - The project is divided into four main sections, each of which contains several questions.
     - Section 1: Data Visualization
         - In this section, we'll use the tswift DataFrame to create visualizations that will help us answer questions about Taylor Swifts's music, including:
             - How many songs did Taylor Swift release each year?
             - How do different audio features such as "Loudness" and "Energy" relate to one another?
             - Are Taylor Swift's songs generally more positive or more negative?
             - Which Taylor Swift album has the most songs in a minor key?
     - Section 2: Song Recommender
         - In this section, we'll create a Taylor Swift song recommender tool. The tool will allow you to input a song you like, selected from a collection of popular songs on Spotify, and it will recommend to you the songs in Taylor Swift's body of work that are most similar to your input song.
     - Section 3: Lyric Searcher
         - In this section, we'll create a Taylor Swift lyric searcher.
     - Section 4: Keywords
         - In this section, we'll identify keywords that summarize each song in Taylor Swift's album "Lover".

 Final Project:
 - Leverage meteorite data to conduct hypothesis testing and probability analysis, uncovering statistical patterns that contribute to a deeper understanding of celestial events and their potential impact on Earth.
